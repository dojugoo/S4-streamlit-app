# Practicum - Sprint 4 - Software Development Tools Project

## Description of Project
The purpose of this project is to build and deploy a web application dashboard to a cloud service. 

The tools used include Git and GitHub, coding via Python with the following packages: pandas, streamlit, plotly-express, VS Code for code editing, and deploying the application to Render.

## Description of Application
The main dataset that is explored in the application contains data on vehicle advertisement and sales listing in the US. The information listed includes details of the vehicle listing, such as the price, model year, condition of the car, odometer reading, date posted, and number of days listed. 

From the drop down list of car brands, the user should select the car makes for which they want to see data about. The application will display the relevant histogram and scatter plots from the car advertisement dataset filtered by the user selected car brands. There are additional checkbox options for the histogram to normalize the data, and display fitted trendlines for the scatter plots.
